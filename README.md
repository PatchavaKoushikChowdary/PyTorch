# PyTorch
# Introduction:
It is a fully featured framework building deep learning models,which is a type of machine learning that's commonly used in applications like image recognition and language processing.
PyTorch also have c++ interface that makes it different from Python language.
# Machine learning 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase. They will be required to help identify the most relevant business questions and the data to answer them.Machine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks that accelerate solution development, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
# Tensor
Tensors are a specialized data structure that are very similar to arrays and matrices. In PyTorch, we use tensors to encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the modelâ€™s parameters.A Pytorch Tensor is basically the same as a NumPy array. This means it does not know anything about deep learning or computational graphs or gradients and is just a generic n-dimensional array to be used for arbitrary numeric computation. However, the biggest difference between a NumPy array and a PyTorch Tensor is that a PyTorch Tensor can run on either CPU or GPU. 
# Deep learning
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks. It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data.
# Neural Networks
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons.
